# Simple Project: Calculator ðŸ§®

A simple front-end JavaScript project based on instructions from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) course. This resulting on-screen calculator:
- can perform all four of the **basic mathematic operations** on two operands.
- treats latest answer as operand if the first operand was not given.
- can **handle errors** like division with zero and NaN entries.
- features a **clear, negate and delete button** for added functionality.
- features **keyboard binding**, with <kbd>Esc</kbd> for clear, <kbd>Backspace</kbd> for del, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> for equals.

See it in action here in its [**Github.io page**](https://nadinesiccion.github.io/Calculator/)!
